			<p>Characterized by its long legs, long neck, and distinctive spotted pattern, many people first believed the giraffe was a cross between a leopard and a camel, which is reflected in its scientific name, Giraffa camelopardalis. Fully grown giraffes stand 4.3–5.7 m (14.1–18.7 ft) tall, with males taller than females. </p>
